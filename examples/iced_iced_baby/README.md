This example demonstrates the use of Vanilla Iced in combination with [gstreamer-rs](https://github.com/sdroege/gstreamer-rs) and a [hacky widget](../hacky_widget/README.md) to play video and audio within an Iced application.

To run the example use `cargo run` from this directory.

Note that you will need GStreamer installed in order to compile and run this example. Follow the [gstreamer-rs installation](https://github.com/sdroege/gstreamer-rs?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) instructions for your platform.
